# LVGL_7_PC_SIMULATOR
a lvgl simulator to build under msys2 environment [underwork]
I made my special version of simulator which is basically based on [lv_port_pc_eclipse
](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_eclipse/tree/dev-7.0) to be use with windows enviroment, so I made a slight modifications to make it work, as soon as I finish it I will make a tutorial to build this project,
but for now I use it for my own purposes.
