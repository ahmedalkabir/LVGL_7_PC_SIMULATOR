# LVGL_7_PC_SIMULATOR
a lvgl simulator to build under msys2 environment [underwork]
I made my special version of the simulator which is basically based on [lv_port_pc_eclipse
](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_eclipse/tree/dev-7.0) to be used with windows environment, so I made some modifications to make it work, as soon as I finish it I will make a tutorial of how to build this project,
but for now I'm using it for my own purposes.
